Basic idea: store associative data structure:

STRUCT
    Vessel1
        Part1
            1 (index in storedParts collection)
                Propellant: 2.1
            3
                Propellant: 1.1
        Part2
            1
                Propellant: 1.0
    Vessel2
        Part1
            1
                Propellant: 1.5

Questions
- Can this abstract away to an EVAKerbal without any hardcoding?
- How do I save/load this data?
- How do I prevent/override the game resetting the EVA amounts in the jetpack/containers

Item names:
- evaJetpack
- evaCylinder
